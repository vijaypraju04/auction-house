This was a React application with fully functioning authentication. We wanted to make this application a game originally where each user had a set amount of money and they could bid on each auction item and collect them. The users are then able to put up their own auction items and collect money from the highest bidder. The auction is listed on the market for all users until the timer comes to an end.
